## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Coupa instance with OAuth application configured
- Required environment variables (see Setup section)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd miniSmash-Invoice-Creator
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install streamlit requests pandas pillow easyocr pdf2image streamlit-tags
```

3. Set up environment variables (see Configuration section)

4. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run pdf_to_csv.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables for your target environments:

**Test Environment:**
- `COUPA_INSTANCE` - Your Coupa instance name (e.g., "mycompany")
- `PO_IDENTIFIER` - Your OAuth client identifier
- `PO_SECRET` - Your OAuth client secret

**Production Environment:**
- `COUPA_INSTANCE_PROD` - Production instance name
- `PO_IDENTIFIER_PROD` - Production OAuth client identifier  
- `PO_SECRET_PROD` - Production OAuth client secret

### Required OAuth Scopes (Client Credentials Grant)

Your OAuth application in Coupa must have these scopes:
- `core.purchase_order.read` - Read PO information
- `core.invoice.read` - Check for duplicate invoices
- `core.invoice.write` - Create new invoices

## üìñ How to Use

### 1. Configure Settings (Sidebar)
- **Environment**: Select Test or Production environment
- **PO Prefixes**: Set prefixes to search for (looks for prefix + 6 digits, e.g., RCH123456, PO456789)
- **Auto-detect Invoice Numbers**: Toggle automatic extraction using patterns like:
  - "INVOICE NUMBER:", "INVOICE NO:", "INVOICE#", "INVOICE #:", "INV:", "INVOICE:"
  - Looks for numbers immediately following these text patterns
- **Auto-detect Dates**: Toggle automatic date extraction supporting formats like:
  - DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD (with /, -, or . separators)
  - Month names: "January 15, 2024", "15 January 2024"
  - Compact formats: DDMMYYYY, YYYYMMDD
- **Debug Mode**: Enable detailed API logging and OCR troubleshooting information

### 2. Upload Your Document
- Upload a PDF, image, or ZIP file with your invoices
- The app will find PO numbers and invoice details automatically
- Works with: PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIF, TIFF, BMP, GIF, ZIP
- Large files (over 10MB) will show warnings but still work

### 3. Verify POs in Coupa
- Click "Verify POs in Coupa" to check your PO numbers are real
- The app will also look for duplicate invoices at the same time
- You'll see progress bars and results for each PO

### 4. Edit Invoice Details
- Each PO gets its own section where you can make changes
- Invoice numbers and dates are filled in automatically
- Edit quantities, prices, and descriptions in the table
- Changes auto-save when you click away (no Enter key needed)
- Use ‚ûï buttons to add new lines or üóëÔ∏è checkboxes to delete lines
- "‚Ü©Ô∏è Restore All" button brings back the original data if you make mistakes

### 5. Review What You're Creating
- The summary table shows all invoices ready to create
- Use checkboxes in the "Include" column to pick which ones you want
- Problem invoices (duplicates, errors) are automatically unchecked for safety
- You can still edit invoice numbers directly in this table
- Check the totals and line counts look right

### 6. Create Your Invoices
- Production users must check a safety box first
- Click "Create Invoices" to process your selected invoices
- You'll see detailed progress bars showing each step:
  - "Processing 1/5: PO 123456" with percentage complete
  - Individual stages like "Creating invoice..." and "Uploading file..."
  - Warnings if files are large and might be slow
- Results show success/failure with helpful error messages

## üîß How It Works

- Uses OCR to extract PO numbers, invoice numbers, and dates from documents
- Verifies PO numbers in Coupa and checks for duplicate invoices
- Provides easy editing interface with auto-save functionality
- Creates invoices in batch with progress tracking

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Production Warnings**: Big red warnings when you're working with real data
- **Duplicate Detection**: Finds existing invoices and warns you before creating duplicates  
- **Confirmation Steps**: Makes you confirm before doing anything important

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Turn On Debug Mode
Enable Debug Mode in the sidebar to see what's happening:
- **File Processing**: See how long things take and what was found in your documents
- **API Calls**: Watch the app communicate with Coupa (passwords hidden for security)
- **Errors**: Get clear explanations of what went wrong and how to fix it
- **Performance**: See if your computer is using GPU acceleration for faster processing

### Common Issues

- **PO numbers not found**: Check PO prefixes and document quality
- **Environment errors**: Verify Coupa credentials and OAuth setup
- **Large files**: Files over 10MB process slower, over 20MB may timeout
- **Performance**: First run takes 30-60s for OCR setup, then much faster
